💀 DigitalDeadHeads: The Unbroken Chain Project ⚡️"Standing on the moon, with nothing left to do... a lovely view of heaven, but I'd rather be with you."Welcome to the digital frontier. The Unbroken Chain Project is a mission to move the Grateful Dead archives into a fully decentralized ecosystem. We aren't just building a repository; we are ensuring that the music, the history, and the spirit of the Dead remain immutable and community-owned—forever.🌹 The Pioneers of DecentralizationLong before the advent of Web3, the Grateful Dead pioneered the concept of decentralized distribution. By encouraging fans to tape and trade shows, they bypassed corporate gatekeepers and built the world's first peer-to-peer music network.We are honoring that legacy by moving those tapes from centralized servers to the "Chain."In Loving Memory & CelebrationThis project launched in early 2026 to honor the legends who have moved on to the next stage:MemberRoleLegacyJerry GarciaLead Guitar/VocalsThe Guiding Light (1942–1995)Bob WeirRhythm Guitar/VocalsThe Storyteller (1947–2026)Phil LeshBass/VocalsThe Harmonic Architect (1940–2024)Donna Jean GodchauxVocalsThe Soulful Mezzo-Soprano (1947–2025)Keith GodchauxKeyboardsThe Grand Pianist (1948–1980)The KeysKeyboardsPigpen, Brent, and Vince

We celebrate life with Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart as we take up the mantle as the digital tapers of the 21st century.

🛠 The Mission: Decentralize the Vault
Immutability: Once a show is on-chain (IPFS/Arweave), it is permanent. No corporate entity can "delete" a performance.

Open Source Spirit: Just as the Dead allowed the music to be free, our code and metadata are open to all.

Community Governance: The "Vault" belongs to the Heads. We use decentralized protocols to ensure the music stays accessible to everyone.

🤖 Meet the Digital Archivist
To help us navigate this long, strange trip, we’ve deployed a specialized AI agent:

Name: Digital Archivist

Location: .github/agents/digital-archivist.yml

Purpose: Maintaining code standards, validating show dates, and onboarding new contributors to the "Chain."

🎸 Join the Caravan
Whether you're a developer or a taper:
