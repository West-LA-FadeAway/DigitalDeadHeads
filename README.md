💀 DigitalDeadHeads: The Unbroken Chain Project ⚡️"Standing on the moon, with nothing left to do... a lovely view of heaven, but I'd rather be with you."Welcome to the digital frontier. The Unbroken Chain Project is a mission to move the Grateful Dead archives into a fully decentralized ecosystem. We aren't just building a repository; we are ensuring that the music, the history, and the spirit of the Dead remain immutable and community-owned—forever.🌹 The Pioneers of DecentralizationLong before the advent of Web3, the Grateful Dead pioneered the concept of decentralized distribution. By encouraging fans to tape and trade shows, they bypassed corporate gatekeepers and built the world's first peer-to-peer music network.We are honoring that legacy by moving those tapes from centralized servers to the "Chain."In Loving Memory & CelebrationThis project launched in early 2026 to honor the legends who have moved on to the next stage:MemberRoleLegacyJerry GarciaLead Guitar/VocalsThe Guiding Light (1942–1995)Bob WeirRhythm Guitar/VocalsThe Storyteller (1947–2026)Phil LeshBass/VocalsThe Harmonic Architect (1940–2024)Donna Jean GodchauxVocalsThe Soulful Mezzo-Soprano (1947–2025)Keith GodchauxKeyboardsThe Grand Pianist (1948–1980)The KeysKeyboardsPigpen, Brent, and Vince
