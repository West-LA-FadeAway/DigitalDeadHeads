⚡️ The Unbroken Chain Manifesto: Pioneers of the P2P Spirit
1. The Original Peer-to-Peer Network
Long before the internet was a household utility, the Grateful Dead were building a decentralized network. By designating "Taping Sections" and allowing fans to record and trade their live performances, they bypassed the centralized control of record labels and distribution monopolies. They understood that the music belonged to the moment and the community, not a corporate vault.

2. A Living Archive
With the passing of Phil Lesh (2024), Donna Jean Godchaux (2025), and most recently, our captain Bob Weir (2026), the physical "living" archive is transitioning. We honor Keith Godchaux, Jerry Garcia, and all who have gone before by ensuring their vibrations are never silenced.

Our mission is to move this legacy from "perishable" centralized servers—which are subject to link rot, subscription fees, and censorship—onto an immutable, decentralized "Unbroken Chain."

3. The Pillars of the Project
Zero Gatekeepers: No one should have to pay a subscription to hear a 1977 soundboard. The music was a gift; it remains a gift.

Radical Transparency: Every digital file should have a verifiable provenance. We use blockchain technology to ensure that the "taper's lineage" is preserved forever.

Community Custodianship: As long as there is one "Head" running a node, the music lives. We are moving from a "Service" model to a "Survival" model.

4. Beyond the Music
The Grateful Dead were more than a band; they were a proof-of-concept for decentralized governance and community-driven development. They proved that a "headless" community (no pun intended) could sustain itself for decades through shared values and mutual respect. We apply those same principles to our code and our data architecture.

"Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell..."
